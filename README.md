**ABSTRACT** 
	
In the current landscape, both companies and educational institutions rely heavily on manual processes to validate student academic credentials, which can be susceptible to fraudulent verification through bribery or manipulation by employees. Some universities have attempted to address this issue by maintaining student credentials in centralized servers. However, these centralized systems are not foolproof, as internal database administrators can manipulate data, leading to potential security breaches and service disruptions.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a Blockchain-based student credential verification system. Blockchain inherently supports data verification, encryption, and distributed data storage. By storing data in a decentralized manner across multiple nodes, the system ensures resilience in case of node failures, providing uninterrupted services.
Blockchain's built-in tamper-proof features involve storing each data record as a block or transaction, associating it with a unique hash code. When new records are added, the Blockchain verifies the hash codes of all previous blocks. If the data remains unchanged, the hash codes match, resulting in successful verification. Any attempt to alter data would lead to a hash code mismatch, triggering a verification failure and detection of data tampering.

RESULTS/DISCUSSION
10.1 SYSTEM TESTING
The purpose of testing is to discover errors. Testing is the process of trying to discover every conceivable fault or weakness in a work product. It provides a way to check the functionality of components, sub-assemblies, assemblies and/or a finished product It is the process of exercising software with the intent of ensuring that the Software system meets its requirements and user expectations and does not fail in an unacceptable manner. There are various types of test. Each test type addresses a specific testing requirement.
TYPES OF TESTS
UNIT TESTING
                     Unit testing involves the design of test cases that validate that the internal program logic is functioning properly, and that program inputs produce valid outputs. All decision branches and internal code flow should be validated. It is the testing of individual software units of the application .it is done after the completion of an individual unit before integration. This is a structural testing, that relies on knowledge of its construction and is invasive. Unit tests perform basic tests at component level and test a specific business process, application, and/or system configuration. Unit tests ensure that each unique path of a business process performs accurately to the documented specifications and contains clearly defined inputs and expected results.
INTEGRATION TESTING
                             Integration tests are designed to test integrated software components to determine if they actually run as one program.  Testing is event driven and is more concerned with the basic outcome of screens or fields. Integration tests demonstrate that although the components were individually satisfaction, as shown by successfully unit testing, the combination of components is correct and consistent. Integration testing is specifically aimed at   exposing the problems that arise from the combination of components.
 
FUNCTIONAL TEST
                   Functional tests provide systematic demonstrations that functions tested are available as specified by the business and technical requirements, system documentation, and user manuals.
 Functional testing is centered on the following items:
       Valid Input                :  identified classes of valid input must be accepted.
       Invalid Input              : identified classes of invalid input must be rejected.
       Functions                   : identified functions must be exercised.
       Output           	      : identified classes of application outputs must be exercised.
       Systems/Procedures   : interfacing systems or procedures must be invoked.
                       Organization and preparation of functional tests is focused on requirements, key functions, or special test cases. In addition, systematic coverage pertaining to identify Business process flows; data fields, predefined processes, and successive processes must be considered for testing. Before functional testing is complete, additional tests are identified and the effective value of current tests is determined.
SYSTEM TEST
                       System testing ensures that the entire integrated software system meets requirements. It tests a configuration to ensure known and predictable results. An example of system testing is the configuration-oriented system integration test. System testing is based on process descriptions and flows, emphasizing pre-driven process links and integration points.
WHITE BOX TESTING
                        White Box Testing is a testing in which in which the software tester has knowledge of the inner workings, structure and language of the software, or at least its purpose. It is purpose. It is used to test areas that cannot be reached from a black box level.
BLACK BOX TESTING
                         Black Box Testing is testing the software without any knowledge of the inner workings, structure or language of the module being tested. Black box tests, as most other kinds of tests, must be written from a definitive source document, such as specification or requirements document, such as specification or requirements document. It is a testing in which the software under test is treated, as a black box you cannot “see” into it. The test provides inputs and responds to outputs without considering how the software works.
UNIT TESTING
                         Unit testing is usually conducted as part of a combined code and unit test phase of the software lifecycle, although it is not uncommon for coding and unit testing to be conducted as two distinct phases.
TEST STRATEGY AND APPROACH
	               Field testing will be performed manually and functional tests will be written in detail.
Test objectives
•	All field entries must work properly.
•	Pages must be activated from the identified link.
•	The entry screen, messages and responses must not be delayed.

Features to be tested
•	Verify that the entries are of the correct format
•	No duplicate entries should be allowed
•	All links should take the user to the correct page.
Integration Testing
                      Software integration testing is the incremental integration testing of two or more integrated software components on a single platform to produce failures caused by interface defects.
The task of the integration test is to check that components or software applications, e.g. components in a software system or – one step up – software applications at the company level – interact without error.

Test Results: All the test cases mentioned above passed successfully. No defects encountered.
ACCEPTANCE TESTING
User Acceptance Testing is a critical phase of any project and requires significant participation by the end user. It also ensures that the system meets the functional requirements.
Test Results: All the test cases mentioned above passed successfully. No defects encountered

This project addresses the inadequacies of existing systems by introducing a decentralized, tamper-proof framework that not only enhances the trustworthiness of credentials but also streamlines the entire verification process. By empowering universities, companies, and students with secure access to authenticated records, the proposed system ensures a seamless, transparent, and efficient credential verification process, ultimately contributing to a more trustworthy and resilient hiring ecosystem.
